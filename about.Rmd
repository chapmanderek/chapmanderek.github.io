### About me

I currently live in the amazing state of Hawaii.  I couldn't be prouder of my friends and neighbors over the past two years.  I was at my previous employer for over 11 years and the tech guy for 6 years.  I am grateful for the support they gave me while I pursued my masters.

I have a wonderful wife, great daughter, and two dogs that teach me patience each day.

### Education

In December of 2021 I completed my Master of Computer Science in Data Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  I earned a 4.0 throughout the entire program.  Prior to starting my master I took a number of classes from the University of Michigan and John Hopkins University focusing on Python and Data Science to make sure I was prepared for a program as rigorous as the UIUC MCS-DS program.  

While a student I was featured by Coursera in one of their newsletters!
