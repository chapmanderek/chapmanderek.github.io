## About Derek Chapman

I currently live in the amazing state of Hawaii.  I couldn't be prouder of my friends and neighbors over the past two years.  I have been at my current employer for the past 10 years and in my current position for the past 6 years.  I am grateful for the support they have given me while I pursed my masters.  

I have a wonderful wife, great daughter, and two dogs that teach my patience each day.
