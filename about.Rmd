I currently live in the amazing state of Hawaii.  I couldn't be prouder of my friends and neighbors over the past two years.  I have been at my current employer for the past 10 years and in my current position for the past 6 years.  I am grateful for the support they have given me while I pursued my masters.  

I have a wonderful wife, great daughter, and two dogs that teach me patience each day.

### Education

In December of 2021 I completed my Masters of Computer Science in Data Science at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  I earned a 4.0 throughout the entire program.  Prior to starting my masters I took a number of classes from the University of Michigan and John Hopkins University focusing on Python and Data Science to make sure I was prepared for a program as rigorous as the UIUC MCS-DS program.  

While a student I was featured by Coursera in one of their newsletters!
