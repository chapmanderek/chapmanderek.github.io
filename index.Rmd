These are both personal/hobby projects as well as projects from graduate school.  If you're interested in hiring me please check my [contact page](contact.html) for information on getting in touch.  Im actively looking for a data science/analyst/wrangler position and would be happy to talk with you about what is available at your company.  I am open to local positions in Hawaii, remote work, and relocating.
