## Portfolio

### Current/Recent Projects

#### **This Website!**

Built entirely in R Studio as an RMarkdown website.  My last few classes were either Python or Java and I was looking for a way to get back into RStudio.

#### **Out of Order Book Finder**

For our final project in an IoT class our team worked on a "Out of Order Book Finder".  Our autonomous vehicle would drive along a row of books checking the call number labels for books that may have been out of order and uploading the results to an frontend interface for the end user.

Technologies used: Autonomous driving, Obstacle Avoidance, Computer Vision, OCR, AWS.  
Written primarily in Python using OpenCV and Pytesseract.

### Graduate School Projects/Portfolio

#### Nowcasting Gentrification Presentation

I did an in depth review for a paper/method by Giovanni Quattrone's group.  They used AirBnB data to 'nowcast' (as opposed to predict) where gentrification was occuring in several large and medium sized cities.
