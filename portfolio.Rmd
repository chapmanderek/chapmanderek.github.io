## Current/Recent Projects

### **This Website**

Built entirely in R Studio as an RMarkdown website.  My last few classes were either Python or Java and I was looking for a way to get back into RStudio.

### **Out of Order Book Finder**

For our final project in an IoT class our team worked on a "Out of Order Book Finder".  Our autonomous vehicle would drive along a row of books checking the call number labels for books that may have been out of order and uploading the results to a frontend interface for the end user.

Technologies used: Autonomous driving, Obstacle Avoidance, Computer Vision, OCR, AWS.  
Written primarily in Python using OpenCV and Pytesseract.

### **What Period Is It?!?**

This project was an interesting view into what makes a project 'popular'.  This website was by far the most popular project/website I've put together.  I believe because it alleviated a common pain point in a simple manner it gained at lot of usage.  The school I currently work at has an insanely difficult bell schedule to follow.  For staff that need to interact with all grade levels throughout the day it was a constant frustration to figure out what period it was... hence my simple but effective website.  After getting a number of feature requests I rebuilt the website using a JavaScript implementation of Pandas so that I could more easily fix issues and add requested features.

Technologies Used: JavaScript, Danfo.js

## Graduate School Projects/Portfolio

### **Nowcasting Gentrification Presentation**

I did an in-depth review of a paper/method by Giovanni Quattrone's group.  They used AirbnB data to 'nowcast' (as opposed to predict) where gentrification was occurring in several large and medium sized cities.

Skills Used:  Presentation, Report Writing, Deep Review of a Cutting-Edge Research Paper

### **Predicting Health Inspection Scores**

We were tasked with taking Yelp data and predicting what a future Health Inspection Score would be for a variety of restaurants.

Technologies Used: Sentiment Analysis, Doc2Vec, Classification using Linear Regression and Random Forest, data cleaning, multiple large datasets.

### **Nutrition Explorer - Narrative Visualization**

For our Visualization class i built a webpage that allowed the end user to interactively explore various facets of food nutrition.  There isn't any direct messaging as the webpage allows the user to 'drill down' and view information cards (formatted to look similar to the USDA nutrition label).  The entire webpage is built from scratch without use of any packages other than D3 and a slider.

Technologies Used: JavaScript, D3, CSS, Data Cleaning.

### **Sepsis Prediction - Deep Learning for Health Care**

Our team investigated and implemented a state of the art LSTM Neural Network to predict Septic Shock in ER patients.  Our model could predict shock significantly earlier than previous models or the currently accepted clinical tools.  This project incorporated a number of *soft skills* since we had a diverse team living in 4 different time-zones.  Because I was in the middle i often was the liaison between all of the team members and helped to assign tasks as well as coordinate the integration of the various parts.

Skills Used:  Neural Network Creation, Large Dataset Cleaning, Team Coordination, Project Integration.
